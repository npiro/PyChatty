# Marks and Spencer team

__Objective:__ we are aiming to build a proof of concept chatbot, based on customer service chat data, provided by M&S.

__Data:__ provided by M&S, ca. 250 MB of chat data between clients and customer service agents.

__Structure of project:__ Each of us have a folder (kind of like a safe sandbox) where we test out ideas. The rest of the project is organised in a linear fashion in the app folder, going from raw XML to model to application as indicated by the leading numbers in the folder names.
